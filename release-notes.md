Dawn 9.0.0 introduces app blocks in header, video upload with auto-loop, "Click and hover" zoom, new desktop header menu style, a gift card recipient form, and some performance improvements on images.

### Added
- You can now incorporate eligible app blocks directly into your header section, to the left of your cart icon.
- You can upload video files directly to Shopify and showcase them in the Video section. Additionally, you have the option to enable automatic video looping.
- We introduced a new "Click and hover" zoom option on desktop for product page images to add a more subtle hover effect.
- We've added a new style option to the desktop header menu, allowing you to collapse it into a hamburger icon with a popout drawer for a more compact and streamlined menu experience.
- We added a language and currency switcher to the header section for shops selling in multiple currencies or languages.
- The Slideshow, Image Banner, and Image with Text sections now have a subtle background animation option, which adds depth and dynamism to the overall design.
- You can allow gift cards to be sent to a recipient with a new form on the gift card product page.

### Changed
- Important: The Richtext section heading type has been changed. This might result in your heading text being set back to the default value "Talk about your brand". This can happen when manually upgrading to this version.
- We reordered the "Color scheme" setting to improve hierarchy in the header section.
- The “Follow on Shop” option is enabled by default in the footer.
- Section headings now provide more formatting options like bold, italic, and links.

### Fixes and improvements
- We improved the performance of the Multicolumn section by reducing the image sizes being loaded.
- We fixed the blog post slides to show a preview of the subsequent slide.
- We optimized the logo width to ensure the image looked crisp on all device sizes.
