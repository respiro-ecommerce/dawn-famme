Dawn 7.0.0 introduces several fixes and enhancements to make the themes even more flexible and easy to use. We now offer additional customization options in the header to change the position of your logo, new ways of displaying your product page and featured product images, and a new complementary product block to help boost sales.

### Added
- The announcement bar section has a new setting that lets you set the text alignment.
- The header is now more flexible. We added a new logo position option called “Middle center” to feature your logo in the center and your navigation menu on the left, on larger screens.
- The product information section has a new layout option that allows you to split your product images into a two-column grid.
- The product information section has a new block that allows you to display complementary products.
- The product information and featured product sections now allow desktop media to be displayed on the left or on the right on larger screens.
- We added pagination to the main collection list.
- We introduced the ability to add and reorder sections, including app sections, to the customer account pages.

### Changed
- Important: We introduced new theme settings to style “product cards”, “blog cards” and “collection cards” separately. Prior to this update, all these components were styled with the cards’ theme settings. If you have previously updated the style of your cards, this update may cause visual changes to your product cards, blog cards, or collection cards. This can be modified by adjusting their styling in theme settings.
- We introduced a new setting on the collage section to let you apply product card styling to all card types featured in the section.
