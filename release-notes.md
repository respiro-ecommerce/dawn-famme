Dawn 6.0.0 introduces a new cart drawer feature, additional customization options on the rich text section, and various fixes and enhancements.

### Added
- We introduced a new cart behavior setting offering the options to surface a cart drawer, a pop up notification, or link directly to the cart page upon adding an item to cart. 
- The rich text section is now more flexible. You can now customize the desktop content position, the content alignment, the size and formatting of headings, and the number of blocks added to the section.
- Important: We introduced new settings to the header section to control top and bottom padding. This update may cause a visual change to your header. This can be modified by adjusting the bottom padding value.

### Fixes and improvements

- On larger screen sizes, the quick add modal included unnecessary empty space. This is now fixed. 
- We fixed an issue where the product media gallery sometimes hid the subsequent media when larger values of horizontal grid space were used. 
- The product media gallery included unnecessary empty space between the product media and the gallery controls. This is now fixed.
- We fixed an issue where the collapsible content section and the collapsible content block were missing bottom padding within each collapsible tab. 
- We fixed an issue where hiding the background of the content container on the slideshow section would not work if a gradient was set as the background color.
- The recaptcha badge was not visible on the contact form. This is now fixed.
